# Open Connections Digest
This Plugin creates a Job that when run will send out an email to every connector in the selected group with a list of open connection request. It creates a new system email, Jobtype, and a new Job set to run on Wednesdays every week. All you have to do is activate the Job, select your connector group, and you'll be up and running. No longer is there a need to create a complicated workflow to send out those open requet emails.

Adds
